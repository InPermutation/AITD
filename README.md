A game where you program a truck

Ideas
=====
* GitHub login
* Public profiles ("high scores")
* Persistence: Boring server DB? localStorage? GitHub repo???
* Scriptable truck (Lua or JS?)
* Reflectable, fully-documented Truck API
* Who cares about graphics?!
* Realistic-ish physics (air resistance, friction, inertia, tires, center of gravity [sweet flips])
* Level-based gameplay
    - Each level has 3 objectives (like "stars" in most f2p games)
    - Must get 1 star to continue to next level
    - Must get all 3 stars to show up as completed on your profile
    - Statistics on #Attempts, #Tokens, completion time, etc.
    - Level 1: Accelerator
        1. Get truck to move  
        2. Get truck to 30kilounits/hr
        3. Maintain speed above 30ku/hr but below 35mph for 10 seconds
    - Level 2: Brakes
        1. Stop the truck
        2. Stop the truck within 1000ku
        3. Stop the truck at 500u (+/- length of truck)
    - Backing up
    - Avoid static obstacle
    - Change Lanes
    - Parking
    - Add in the articulated trailer
        - B-doubles?
        - Road train??
        - SoOoOo crazy!
    - Parking, reverse (i.e. cargo dock)
    - Three-point turn
    - Roundabout
    - Exit
    - Traffic lights, stop signs
    - Merge into traffic
    - Manual transmission?
